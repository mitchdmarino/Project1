                        <li>Set yourself up for victory by protecting your flag. It's best practice to place
                            the flag in the back row surrounded by bombs. Make sure to keep a few strong pieces near the flag in case 
                            the enemy attacks!

                        <li>Capture the enemy's flag before they capture yours!</li>
                        <li>When it is your turn, you may move a soldier (that isn't a flag or bomb) one space horizontally or vertically.
                            Blue lake spaces are impassable, as are spaces occupied by a teammate.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>To move, click on a soldier and press WASD or the Arrow Keys. If the space is valid, your character will move and 
                            your turn will end.
