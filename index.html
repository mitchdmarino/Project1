                <p>Welcome to <a id='stratego-wiki'href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego" target="blank">Stratego</a>, the classic board game where two players face off in battle!
                In order to win, eliminate all of the enemy troops OR capture the enemy flag!</p>
                <h3>Game Rules</h3>
                <h4>Turns</h4>
                <p>Each player sets up their board. Each player alternates turns. During a turn, a player moves one of their tokens
                    one space in the horizontal or vertical direction. Players cannot move to a space 
                    if it is already occupied by a friendly (same color) token. Lake spaces in the middle of the board 
                    are also impassable.                
                </br>
                </br>
                If a player moves their token onto a space occupied by the other team, each token will battle. The token with the stronger rank will win. 
                    In this version, the lower number is considered stronger and will win. 
                    For example, a 1 beats 2,3,4,5... , a 2 beats 3,4,5... and so on. 
                
                The rank of opposing soldiers is not revealed until battle is initiated with them.</p>
                <h4>Winning</h4>
                <p>Win the game by capturing the opponents flag, or by eliminating all of their movable pieces.

                </p>
                <h3>Game Set-Up</h3>
                <p>Prior to starting the game, arrange your tokens in a custom configuration by selecting 'Choose Setup'.
                    If inputting soldier ranks manually, select a token and type in the desired rank (1-7, or 'f' for flag)
                    to input that soldier's rank. Once a token's rank is set, the only way to reset is by hitting the 'reset' button, 
                    so choose your ranks wisely! 
                    Note: if you have already added the maximum number of a certain rank, you will not be able to add that rank again unless you reset.
                    The army must consist of the following to start the game: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 Marshall, rank 1</li>
                        <li>1 General, rank 2</li>
                        <li>3 Colonels, rank 3</li>
                        <li>4 Majors, rank 4</li>
                        <li>4 Captains, rank 5</li>
                        <li>5 Lieutenants, rank 6</li>
                        <li>5 Sergeants, rank 7</li>
                    </ul>

                </br>
                    If desired, select random-configuration to set up tokens randomly. 
                    Once you are satisfied with your setup, click 'Start' to begin.
